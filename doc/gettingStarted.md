# Getting Started

This article describes all the neccessary steps to compile your first application with Madgine.

## Dependencies

The Madgine is built using CMake. It can be downloaded [here](https://cmake.org/download/). 
All source and library dependencies are included in the repository itself.
A fully C++17 conforming compiler is necessary.

## Building The Madgine

Download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/MadManRises/Madgine).

Generate the solution using CMake and your preferred compiler and IDE. It is recommended to provide a build
directory outside of the source directory tree. There are no additional CMake settings necessary. Build the
solution and start `MadgineLauncher`. The executable (including the platform suffix for executables) can be 
found in the `bin` folder. Congratulations, you successfully compiled the Madgine Framework.
