# Tooling

The plugin-based design of the Madgine-framework allows tools to be integrated directly into the framework and then be disabled for a release build. This has the advantage of getting easy access to all information, but at the same time increases the risk to introduce dependencies from core features into tools. This page describes some concepts that try to mitigate that risk. It also describes the rich basis implementation for tooling support already available in the framework.
